## Testing

Automated and manual testing were conducted during this project. I also have validated all files using online validation sites cited bellow and checked across differents browsers and devices.
I have tried automated test as much as possible but based on the fact that it is purely running entirely from the XHR itself I couldn't get more done. It is a feature left to implement later after I graduate from the course. I have conducted a detailed [manual testing](testing/manual/testing.md) to show that I have testing done.

### Validators

#### HTML

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - `Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.`

#### CSS

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - `Congratulations! No Error Found.`

#### JavaScript

- [JShint](https://jshint.com/)

### Manual Testing

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

### Remote Deployment

This site was deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the **master branch**.

Deployed Site:

- [https://github.com/Camila-Ribeiro/My-Cookbook_Milestone-Project](https://github.com/Camila-Ribeiro/My-Cookbook_Milestone-Project)

Once you have the project setup locally, you can proceed to deploy it remotely with the following steps:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository:
   - `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO`
2. Click on the **Settings** tab at the top:
   - `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/settings`
3. Scroll down on that page to the **GitHub Pages** section.
4. The first drop-down field should be **Source** with _None_ preselected.
5. Select **master branch** from the list.
6. The page should refresh.
7. Scroll back down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
8. You should now have a deployed link:
   - `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO`

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:

- Please allow a few minutes to pass before opening your newly deployed link! Clicking this link too quickly may result in a failure to build the site, causing an Error 404 page instead.

Congratulations! Your project should be deployed successfully on GitHub Pages! :tada:
